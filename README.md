# FF12-IZJS-Job-and-Party-Randomizer
Randomly chooses 3 party members and jobs for all 6 characters for the IZJS version of FFXII

In it's current form, it is very basic, and is possible for multiple characters to end up with the same job. This is actually an
intended possible result, though there exists the chance that future versions will provide an option to exclude that possibility.

Current known bugs:
- 'Try again' button doesn't work properly in Firefox and IE
